# `apk upgrade` first: the base image is rebuilt on its own schedule, so the
# Alpine packages it ships (openssl in particular, which nginx links against)
# are as old as the last node:24-alpine build. Upgrading at build time pulls
# the patched versions from the branch the base image already pins — patch
# level only, never a distro jump. Without it the published image carries
# whatever CVEs the base picked up since its last rebuild.
#
# Then nginx (static + /api proxy), tzdata (so TZ works on Alpine), and the
# runtime lib for better-sqlite3.

# ── Unprivileged runtime ────────────────────────────────────────────
# Node used to run as root: any code execution inside it owned the container,
# including /app/data — which holds the JWT secret and the token-encryption
# key. docker-entrypoint.sh now runs it as PUID:PGID.
#
# nginx keeps the standard split instead: a root master that binds :80, and
# workers dropped to the unprivileged `nginx` user by the `user` directive.
# The workers are what touch request data; the master only supervises.
#
# This deliberately avoids granting cap_net_bind_service on the nginx binary to
# run the master unprivileged too. That works, but a file capability is refused
# under `no-new-privileges` or `cap_drop: ALL` — a failure mode this image never
# had before. Keeping the master's privileges exactly as they always were means
# the change cannot break a deployment that used to work.

# The runtime only ever runs `node` (see docker-entrypoint.sh) — never npm. Drop
# the base image's bundled npm/npx/corepack: they ship their own dependencies
# (tar, brace-expansion, ip-address, undici, …) whose CVEs would be flagged even
# though nothing here executes them.
